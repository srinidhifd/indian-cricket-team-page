            <h2>About Indian Cricket Team</h2>
            <p>
                The India men's national cricket team, also known as Team India or the
                Men in Blue, represents India in men's international cricket. It is
                governed by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), and is a
                Full Member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) with Test, One
                Day International (ODI) and Twenty20 International (T20I) status.
                Cricket was introduced to India by British sailors in the 18th
                century, and the first cricket club was established in 1792. India's
                national cricket team played its first Test match on 25 June 1932 at
                Lord's, becoming the sixth team to be granted test cricket status.
                India had to wait until 1952, almost twenty years, for its first Test
                victory. In its first fifty years of international cricket, India
                didn't gain much success, winning only 35 of the first 196 Test
                matches it played. The team, however, gained strength in the 1970s
                with the emergence of players like Sunil Gavaskar, Gundappa Viswanath,
                Kapil Dev, and the Indian spin quartet. India has won five major ICC
                tournaments. The team has won the Cricket World Cup twice (1983 and
                2011), the ICC T20 World Cup once (2007) and the ICC Champions Trophy
                twice (2002 and 2013) and have also finished as runners-up in the
                Cricket World Cup once (2003), the T20 World Cup once (2014), and the
                Champions Trophy twice (2000 and 2017). The team were also runners-up
                at the inaugural 2019–2021 ICC World Test Championship. It was the
                second team after West Indies to win the World Cup and the first team
                to win the World Cup at home soil after winning the 2011 Cricket World
                Cup. They have also won the ACC Asia Cup seven times (1984, 1988,
                1990–91, 1995, 2010, 2016, 2018) and have also finished as runners-up
                thrice (1997, 2004, 2008). The team also won the 1985 World
                Championship of Cricket, defeating Pakistan in the final. India have
                also won the ICC Test Championship Mace five times and ICC ODI
                Championship Shield one time. Test rivalries include The
                Border-Gavaskar Trophy (with Australia), the Pautadi Trophy (with
                England), Anthony de Mello Trophy (with England), the Freedom Trophy
                (with South Africa). As of 26 February 2022, India are ranked third in
                Tests, fourth in ODIs and first in T20Is by the ICC.Rohit Sharma is
                the current captain of the team in all formats;the head coach is Rahul
